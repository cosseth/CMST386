        <h2>Responsive Design and CSS Preprocessors</h2>

        <h3>Importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience</h3>
        <p>
            Responsive design is essential because content today is viewed across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. With the rapid rise in mobile usage, it has become crucial to structure layouts, so they adapt seamlessly to different viewports, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience. When content fails to adjust properly, it can lead to frustration, poor engagement, and users abandoning the product altogether. Additionally, responsive design supports accessibility and is rewarded by Search Engine Optimization, as search engines favor websites that dynamically adapt to various devices. This makes responsive design both a user-centric and strategic necessity.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Analytics Reports</h3>
        <p>
            One of the reports that Google Analytics provides is the Engagement Reports, which include the Events Report, Conversion Report, and Pages and Screens Report. These reports offer meaningful data that helps site owners understand how users interact with their content, which pages are used the most, what errors users encounter, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another type of report included is Real-Time Reporting. This report is especially helpful for on-the-spot analysis, providing insight into how active users are interacting with the site, their demographics, what devices they’re using, recognizing traffic patterns, and discovering and troubleshooting issues as they arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Monetization reports are also significantly important for businesses, as they reveal what is driving revenue, user purchase behavior, purchase value, top-performing products, where that traffic comes from, and other vital information that supports business decision-making.
