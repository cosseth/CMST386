					Describe how search engines work
				</h2>
				<p>
					The dynamics of search engine results depend on factors such as the quality and relevance of a page’s content, which are evaluated by automated software called web crawlers. The first step for a page to appear in search results is for its URL to be discovered. In the case of Google, with the vast number of web pages being added constantly, crawlers periodically examine and add new pages to their directory. Crawlers determine which pages to visit, how often to revisit them, and what to do with the collected data. Factors that may influence how a site is explored include request speed, content quality, and server errors. Google only searches publicly available URLs. If a page does not rank well, it may not be indexed, but if it performs well during crawling, it will appear in search results. Additionally, search result rankings are influenced by factors such as keywords, meta tags, relevance, language, location, and more

                <h2>
                    Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags 				
                </h2>
				<p>
                    Search engines rely heavily on specific words to showcase inquiry results. Knowing our target audience, their search behaviors, and potential keywords can significantly enhance our webpage’s search ranking results. However, the sophisticated systems incorporated by search engines help users connect to related content without explicitly using the specific term searched. Meta tags can also enhance SEO by providing specifications such as title, language, viewport, and descriptions.

                <h2>
                    List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links  				
                </h2>
				<ol>
                    <li>
                        The first element of writing relevant content links is encouraging others to link to your content, which naturally happens when you provide high-quality, valuable information. To attract visitors, your site must offer reliable and relevant content that people find useful enough to share or reference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another important factor is linking to websites that are related to your topic or industry. Doing so helps search engines understand your site’s context and relevance, improving how it’s categorized and ranked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using descriptive anchor text is essential for SEO. Incorporate variations of your keywords within your links to boost search visibility, but avoid overusing them to prevent appearing as if you’re manipulating rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select links that attract your target audience. Relevant, high-quality links can drive significant traffic to your site and help establish credibility.
                    </li>
                </ol>	
                <h2>
                    What constitutes good heading hierarchy and includes an example with more than one heading tag 
                </h2>	
                <p>
                    The way we structure our HTML provides essential information about how our websites are organized. This structure improves how our code is read and interpreted by search engines.
                </p>	
                <p>
                    In the example below, the HTML includes tags such as <em>'head', 'body', 'footer', 'nav', and 'figure'</em>. Writing code with meaningful tags helps search engines, other developers, and anyone reviewing the site in the future understand the content and purpose of each section more easily.
